Write a program that inserts 25 random integers from 0 to 100 in sorted order in a linked list. 
The program should calculate the sum of the elements and the floating-point average of the 
elements.

Example:
The list is: 6 12 14 20 27 31 31 34 37 38 56 59 63 66 72 73 73 76 77 79 88 94 95 96 97 *
The sum is: 1414
The average is: 56.560000
