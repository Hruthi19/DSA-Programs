Write a program to implement an AVL Tree having following functionalities.

1. Insert (): This function inserts a new node to an AVL tree. The node contains an integer type of data.
2. BF(): This function returns the balance factor of a given node.
3. LL(): This function performs LL rotation.
4. RR(): This function performs RR rotation.
5. LR(): This function performs LR rotation.
6. RL(): This function performs RL rotation.
7. Display (): This function displays inorder traversal sequence of the AVL tree.

After inserting a new node, if the resulting tree is not AVL then insert function calls appropriated rotation function to make the tree an AVL
