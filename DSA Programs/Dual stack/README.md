Write a program to implement the following algorithm:

1. Start with two indexes one at the left and other at the right end of the array.
2. Left index simulate the first stack and second index simulate the right stack.
3. If we want to put the element in the first stack then put the element at the left index.

Similarly, if we want to put the element in the second stack then put the element at the 
right index.

4. First stack grow towards left and second stack grow towards left
