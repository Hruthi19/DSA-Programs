Write a program to convert a sparse matrix from a 2D array into 

A. An array representation of nx3 size, where n is the number of non-zero elements in the 
sparse matrix and each element is represented by row, column, and data.

B. A chain list (Linked list representation of the sparse matrix where each non-zero element
is represented by a node containing the data, row, column, and a pointer)
